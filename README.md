# McPy

A Minecraft server implementation written in Python

## Why should you use McPy?
McPy aims to be as fast as possible, while keeping as many game mechanics same as vanilla, and including a plugin system by default.

## Where can I download McPy?
McPy is currently under heavy development: very few things are actually working. However, there is a very early alpha avalible: all you need to do is download `startup.py` and run it with **PYTHON 3.8 OR HIGHER**. It'll exit the first time through: simply start it back up to run it. Press Ctrl+C to stop it.

## Wanna help us finding bugs?
Join the early alpha server: `play.skulltown.net:30000` with Minecraft version 1.15.2. 1.16+ will not work.
