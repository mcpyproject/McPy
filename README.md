# McPy

A Minecraft server implementation written in Python

## Why should you use McPy?
McPy aims to be as fast as possible, while keeping as many game mechanics same as vanilla, and including a plugin system by default.

## Where can I download McPy?
McPy is currently under heavy development: very few things are actually working. However, there is a very early alpha avalible: all you need to do is clone the repository (either by download of the .zip file or with git clone). Then run dependencies.py with **PYTHON 3.8 OR HIGHER** and wait for the dependencies to install and the server to start. As with all terminal-based applications, you can use Ctrl + C to abort this task. Run main.py to start the server again.

## Wanna help us finding bugs?
Join the early alpha server: `play.skulltown.net:30000` with Minecraft version 1.15.2. 1.16+ will not work.
