# McPy

A Minecraft server implementation written in Python

## Why should you use McPy?
McPy aims to be as fast as possible, while keeping as many game mechanics same as vanilla, and including a plugin system by default.

## Where can I download McPy?
McPy is currently under heavy development: very few things are actually working. However, there is a very early alpha available: all you need to do is clone the repository (either by download of the .zip file or with git clone). Then run `python3 dependencies.py` for most OSes or `sudo python3 dependencies.py` for Debian-based Linux distributions and wait for the dependencies to install. After that run `python3 main.py` to start the server. As with all terminal-based applications, you can use Ctrl + C to abort this task.

## Wanna help us finding bugs?
Join the early alpha server: `play.skulltown.net:30000` with Minecraft version 1.15.2. 1.16+ will not work.
