- [How do we work with Git, PR & Github](#how-we-use-git)

# How we use Git
- Master branch is only used for new versions. DO NOT MAKE A PULL REQUEST ON THIS BRANCH !
- Develop branch is used when there is a new feature
- For bug fix, there is two kind of bugs:
  - Important bugs:
    - These bugs may be severe - fixing them is a high priority
    - These bugs will have "Important" tag on GitHub
    - When fixed, you should create 2 PRs: One targetting the main branch & one targetting the development branch
    - Make sure to test rigorously - the changes could be applied in production code fairly soon, buggy code would be disastrous
  - Other bugs:
    - These bugs will have "Non-Important" tag on GitHub
    - When fixed, PR should target "develop" branch

## Pull Request
- Use minimal commit ! Squash & rebase your changes whenever you edit your PR before submitting ! Don't do like [this](https://github.com/tazz4843/McPy/pull/20) guy !
- We use some pefixed tags in our PR:
  - [FIX]: When your PR fix a bug
  - [ADD]: When your PR add a new feature
  - [IMP]: When your PR improve something that exists
